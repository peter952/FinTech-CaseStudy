* Incorparated July 2017

* Founded by Philp Barrar with help from Dominique Ferst and Jay Ferst of Ferst Capital Partners. 

* Philip Barrar founded Mylo on his entrepenurial spirit and desire to have a technology start up.  Being a self professed "Bootstapped Entrepreneur" with two startups previously he gained valuable personal finace skills to make his dollar stretch. While being originally from the United States before moving to Canada for university he had experince in using American based personal finace apps that were not being used in Canada.  Seeing a need in his Canadian peer group and wanting to help them he decided to take the best features from the Americans apps plus his personal experience and start Moka (formally Mylo) with the help of Ferst Capital Partners.  
 
 * Funding for Moka was as follows:

## Landscape:  

* Moka is mobile app in the personal financial space to do with saving for a goal and investing. 

* Some of the trends in this space for the past ten years had been the education of new investors, the mobility and freedom outside of the customary banking institutions hours as well as locations. The introduction of fractionalized shares as way for social inclusion in the financial markets.  

* There are some companies that do similar functions to Moka as Questrade, PocketSmith and Wealthsimle Trade. Wealthsimple Invest & Cash is the only real big player that has many of the same features as Moka and would be a true competitor.

## Results  

* So far Moka business impact has been growing. Over 750 000 downloads giving customers an opportunity to save and invest automatically that otherwise would not. Weathsimple Invest & Cash has also added a roundup feature to thier product.

* Downloads and 5 star reviews seem to be how companies are measuring success.

* Moka has 750K downloads and has thousands of 5 star reviews. Incomparison with Wealthsimple that has 175+K and less 5 star reviews. It seems Moka has an edge over Wealthsimple.  

## Recommendations  

* Moka should allow for partners (joint accounts) to use the product together.

* Allow users to pick stock and trade themselves for no fee.

* Add icons to app that a user could touch to save money. Eg. An icon of a coffee, the user decides not drink the coffee so they use the coffee icon so that money goes into thier account instead.  

* Introduce a data wallet

* By adding joint accounts Moka could increase thier user base by including married couples. Letting a customer choose thier own stock could give them a sense of active participation as well as confidence.  Adding an icon could teach financial discipline and makes it easier to save more. A data wallet would give control over to the customers allowing for more security.  

* Existing technolgy would be suitable for all above mentioned except the data wallet technology already in use by Moka would be utilized. Blockchain technology would be best for control of one's data.

* Blockchain being decentralized and unable to hack (so far) is far more secure than technology being used today.
